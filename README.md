#Project Description: Simple To-Do List Application
/*The Simple To-Do List Application is a basic command-line program built using Python that allows users to manage their personal tasks effectively. Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, it provides an interactive menu system where users can:
Add new tasks
View all tasks with their completion status
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks they no longer need
Each task is stored as a dictionary containing a title and a status flag (completed: True/False). All tasks are maintained in a list, allowing dynamic management during the program's execution.
The application uses a loop-driven interface to continuously prompt users for actions until they choose to exit. It also incorporates error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as entering non-numeric values or selecting a task number outside the valid range.*/
